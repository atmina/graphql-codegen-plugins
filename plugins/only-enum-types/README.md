# âš  This package is deprecated!

The official TypeScript plugin received a new config option called `onlyEnums` meaning this plugin is not needed anymore.

It will not receive any further updates.

This package contains a [GraphQL Code Generator](https://graphql-code-generator.com/) plugin that only generates
TypeScript for the enum types of a GraphQL schema.

More information on the usage can be found in [the repository](https://github.com/ATMINA/graphql-codegen-plugins).
